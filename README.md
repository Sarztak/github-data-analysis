# GitHub Data Analysis Project

This project explores GitHub repository data to uncover trends in programming languages, license usage, and commit patterns. The analysis combines PySpark for large-scale processing and visualization tools to highlight key insights.

## Key Features
- **Programming Language Trends**: Analyzed language dominance across GitHub repositories.
- **License Distribution**: Examined correlations between programming languages and license preferences.
- **Commit Patterns**: Investigated commit trends, reasons, and bot contributions.

## Dataset
The dataset was derived from GitHub repositories, including metadata and code files like `requirements.txt`.

## Tools and Technologies
- **PySpark**: Distributed data processing.
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**: Visualization.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation.

## Results
- **Language Dominance**: HTML, CSS and other web languages were the most frequently used languages.
- **License Insights**: Web development languages often paired with MIT licenses.
- **Commit Trends**: Bot activity contributed to uniformity in commit messages.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/github-data-analysis.git
